# Test Plan: @lspec/core Standalone Package

This document holds the per-test-file TC mappings, mock strategy, fixture catalog, per-chunk test totals, and the test count reconciliation that the tech-design index references. It is the source consulted during TDD Red phase: open the listed test file, write the listed tests in the order they appear, write each test against the concrete setup/action/assert column.

The tech-design document carries the architecture decisions. This document carries the test-level operationalization.

## TC → Test Mapping

Every TC in the epic maps to a test in this section. The TC ID appears in the test name or as a leading comment so traceability is visible from the test code alone. Tests are grouped by file because that's the unit a developer opens during implementation.

### Flow 1: Toolchain Migration

#### `tests/foundation.test.ts`

Structural tests for the package directory and configuration. No production code paths involved.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-1.1a | TC-1.1a: package directory contains the required entries | Read the `lspec-core` repo root | List children | `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts` are all present |
| TC-1.1b | TC-1.1b: existing bundled runtime untouched | Capture file SHA list of `liminal-spec/processes/impl-cli/` and `liminal-spec/processes/codex-impl/` from baseline branch | Recompute SHAs after epic work | All file SHAs match the baseline |
| TC-1.2a | TC-1.2a: no bun:test imports remain | Walk `src/` and `tests/` | Grep for `from 'bun:test'` and `from "bun:test"` | Zero matches |
| TC-1.3a | TC-1.3a: package.json declares all four verification scripts | Read `package.json` | Inspect `scripts` block | `red-verify`, `verify`, `green-verify`, `verify-all` keys all present |
| TC-1.4a | TC-1.4a: build output produced | Run `npm run build` in a clean checkout | Inspect `dist/` | `dist/bin/lspec.js`, `dist/sdk/index.js`, and matching `.d.ts` files all present |

#### `tests/verification-scripts.test.ts`

Behavioral tests for each verification tier's composition.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-1.3b | TC-1.3b: red-verify runs format/lint/typecheck/capture | Stub child commands with spies | Invoke `npm run red-verify` | Each sub-command spawned in order; capture-test-baseline runs last |
| TC-1.3b (cont.) | TC-1.3b: verify adds the test suite | Stub child commands | Invoke `npm run verify` | red-verify steps + Vitest invocation observed |
| TC-1.3b (cont.) | TC-1.3b: green-verify adds the immutability guard | Stub child commands; ensure baseline manifest exists | Invoke `npm run green-verify` | verify steps + guard-no-test-changes invocation observed |
| TC-1.3b (cont.) | TC-1.3b: verify-all adds the integration project | Set LSPEC_INTEGRATION=1; stub Vitest | Invoke `npm run verify-all` | verify steps + Vitest with `--project integration` observed |

#### `tests/build-output.test.ts`

CLI bin smoke against the freshly built output.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-1.4b | TC-1.4b: built CLI runs under Node | Run `npm run build` in a temp working copy | Spawn `node dist/bin/lspec.js --help` | Exit code 0; stdout includes the subcommand list |

#### Manual: TC-1.5a (maintainer-run parity check)

TC-1.5a is verified out of band by the maintainer running both suites independently from their respective repos and producing a parity report. No runtime test inside `lspec-core` spawns the bundled suite as a subprocess. The procedure runs once at Story 0 exit, before any hardening or regression-fix work has begun.

The procedure:

1. From `~/code/liminal-spec` run `bun test processes/impl-cli/tests` and capture the per-file outcomes plus aggregate pass/fail counts.
2. From `~/code/lspec-core` run `npm test` and capture the same.
3. Walk both outputs and confirm every test name in the bundled suite has a corresponding test name in the migrated suite. Added structural tests in the migrated suite are permitted on top of the bundled set.
4. Confirm both suites pass with zero failures.
5. Commit the parity record as `parity-report.md` under `docs/spec-build/epics/02-standalone-liminal-sdk-cli/` (or as the Story 0 receipt).

#### `tests/parity.test.ts` (Story 3 exit only — TC-1.5b)

TC-1.5b is the in-repo follow-up that asserts intentional divergence introduced by Story 3 is traceable. It is a single in-repo test that asserts the divergence inventory.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-1.5b | TC-1.5b: intentional divergence allowed in later stories | At Story 3 exit, list divergences from the recorded Story 0 baseline | Inspect each divergence | Each traces to an AC in Flow 4 |

---

### Flow 2: SDK Programmatic Surface

#### `tests/sdk/surface.test.ts`

Public-export-surface tests.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-2.1a | TC-2.1a: every CLI command has a corresponding SDK function | Read CLI command inventory from `src/bin/lspec.ts` | Read public exports from `src/sdk/index.ts` | Every command name maps to a function name in the SDK; ten matches total |
| TC-2.2a | TC-2.2a: public exports are explicit | Walk `src/sdk/index.ts` re-exports | Cross-reference against module reachability from index | No module is reachable from the index that isn't intended; no module not reachable is referenced as public |
| TC-2.2b | TC-2.2b: package.json exports declare distinct subpaths | Read `package.json.exports` | Inspect subpaths | `.` (or `./`), `./sdk`, `./sdk/contracts`, `./sdk/errors` all declared; bin entry distinct |
| TC-2.3a | TC-2.3a: SDK function signatures are typed | Run `tsc --noEmit` against `src/sdk/index.ts` reachable types | Inspect emitted declarations | No `any` or `unknown` in any public function's input or return type |

#### `tests/code-quality/zod-v4-syntax.test.ts`

Static-grep tests asserting the Zod 3 → Zod 4 migration is complete in `src/`.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-2.6a | TC-2.6a: no v3-only schema constructor params | Walk `src/` (excluding `tests/`) | Grep for `errorMap:`, `invalid_type_error:`, and the v3-style `message:` parameter on schema constructors | Zero matches in production code |
| TC-2.6b | TC-2.6b: top-level string formats and post-`ZodEffects` refinements | Walk `src/` | Grep for v3-style `z.string().email()`/`.uuid()`/`.url()` chain forms and any `ZodEffects` import | All string-format declarations use top-level form (`z.email()` / `z.uuidv4()` / `z.url()`); no `ZodEffects` imports remain |

#### `tests/sdk/operations.test.ts`

SDK function behavior tests with mocked filesystem and subprocess.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-2.4a | TC-2.4a: SDK never calls process.exit, writes stdout, or throws on structured failure | Spy on `process.exit` and `process.stdout.write`; render fixture spec pack | Invoke each SDK function for each terminal status (ok/blocked/error/needs-user-decision) | `process.exit` never called; nothing written to stdout; envelope returned to caller on every terminal status; no throw on any structured failure |
| TC-2.4b | TC-2.4b: SDK callable from a script | Build dist; install package locally; run a small Node script importing from `@lspec/core/sdk` | Script calls `inspect({ specPackRoot })` against fixture | Script terminates with valid envelope and exit 0 |
| TC-2.5a | TC-2.5a: dependency-injection adapters are honored | Provide `fs` and `spawn` adapters that record calls | Invoke an SDK operation that touches both | Adapter calls captured; default fs and child_process not invoked |

#### `tests/sdk/per-operation/*.test.ts`

Per-operation envelope-shape tests (ten files, one per operation). Non-TC defensive tests asserting the result envelope matches the documented shape under happy-path and error inputs. These are listed in §Non-TC Decided Tests below.

---

### Flow 3: CLI Invocation Surface

#### `tests/command/help.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-3.1a | TC-3.1a: --help lists all ten subcommands | Build CLI bin | Spawn `node dist/bin/lspec.js --help` | Stdout names each of the ten operations |

#### `tests/command/structure.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-3.2a | TC-3.2a: command modules are thin wrappers | Read each `src/cli/commands/*.ts` source | Inspect each module's body | Module composed of arg parse + SDK call + envelope render + exit-code map; no business logic between the SDK call return and the envelope render |

#### `tests/command/exit-codes.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-3.3a | TC-3.3a: exit codes map deterministically | Stub SDK to return each status | Invoke command and capture `process.exitCode` | `ok` → 0, `error` → 1, `needs-user-decision` → 2, `blocked` → 3 |

#### `tests/command/envelope.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-3.4a | TC-3.4a: stdout envelope shape stable | Run any command with `--json` against fixture | Capture stdout | JSON parses; contains `command`, `version: 1`, `status`, `outcome`, `errors`, `warnings`, `artifacts`, `startedAt`, `finishedAt` |
| TC-3.4b | TC-3.4b: stdout matches persisted artifact | Run any command with `--json` and an artifact path | Read persisted artifact JSON | Equals stdout envelope byte-for-byte |

#### `tests/command/invocation.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-3.5a | TC-3.5a: node invocation works | Build dist | Spawn `node dist/bin/lspec.js inspect --spec-pack-root ./fixture --json` | Exit 0; stdout envelope valid |

#### `tests/command/pack-and-install-smoke.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-3.5b | TC-3.5b: npx invocation against packed tarball | Run `npm pack`; install resulting tarball into a fresh temp project; symlink fixture | Invoke `npx @lspec/core inspect --spec-pack-root ./fixture --json` | Exit 0; envelope valid |

---

### Flow 4: Runtime Contract Hardening

#### `tests/sdk/envelope.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.1a | TC-4.1a: every envelope carries version 1 | Run each command; collect envelopes | Inspect `version` field | Every envelope `version === 1` |

#### `tests/infra/persisted-state.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.1b | TC-4.1b: persisted state files carry version markers | Run any operation that writes run-config consumption, progress snapshot, status file | Read each persisted file | Each has a version marker at document root |

#### `tests/sdk/errors.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.2a | TC-4.2a: structured failure paths surface in envelope.errors with stable codes | Trigger each structured failure path with controlled inputs against a fixture spec pack | Read the returned envelope (no `try/catch` needed — SDK does not throw) | `envelope.status === 'error'` (or `'blocked'` / `'needs-user-decision'` per the failure semantics); `envelope.errors[0].code` is a stable string from the taxonomy; `envelope.errors[0]` matches `{ code, message, detail? }` shape; the SDK function did NOT throw |
| TC-4.2c | TC-4.2c: SDK throws typed errors for programming-error inputs | Construct an SDK function call with input that fails Zod parse at the boundary (e.g., wrong type, missing required key) | Invoke the SDK function and expect a throw | Function throws an instance of `InvalidInputError` (the §Q8 class for boundary parse failures); `error.code` matches the taxonomy; the throw is the documented signal that the caller's input was wrong, not that the workflow failed |

#### `tests/code-quality/no-string-error-detection.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.2b | TC-4.2b: no string-matched error detection in non-test code | Walk `src/` (excluding `tests/`) | Grep for branching against `error.message` substrings (`includes(`, `startsWith(`, regex literals matching message text) | Zero matches in branching logic |

#### `tests/core/schema-derivation.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.3a | TC-4.3a: provider-payload schemas derived from canonical | Read each provider-payload schema declaration | Inspect derivation form | Each is `canonical.omit(...)` or `canonical.pick(...)`; no standalone declaration |
| TC-4.3b | TC-4.3b: drift cannot occur silently | Mutate one canonical field locally; rebuild | Run `tsc --noEmit` and `vitest run` | Mutation surfaces as a build error or test failure, not a runtime fault |

#### `tests/infra/fs-atomic.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.4a | TC-4.4a: atomic-write behavior under simulated rename failure | Stub `fs.rename` to reject; pre-populate destination with prior content | Invoke `writeAtomic(path, newContent)` | `writeAtomic` throws `AtomicWriteError`; destination still contains prior content; no temp file remains in the directory |

#### `tests/infra/index-reservation.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.5a | TC-4.5a: concurrent reservations receive distinct indexes | Set up empty artifacts directory | Call `nextArtifactPath` from two concurrent promises with the same name | Each resolves to a distinct index path; both placeholder files exist; neither overwrites the other |
| TC-4.5c | TC-4.5c: stale placeholder cleanup during reserveIndex | Pre-populate artifacts directory with zero-byte placeholder files for the same `<name>` whose mtimes are older than the configured stale-reservation timeout (default: 5 minutes; use `fs.utimes` to backdate them in test); also create one fresh zero-byte placeholder within the timeout | Call `nextArtifactPath(specPackRoot, name)` | Stale placeholders are unlinked from the directory; the fresh placeholder is preserved; the returned reserved index does NOT skip the slots formerly occupied by stale placeholders; `inspect` is not invoked anywhere in this test path (cleanup happens in `reserveIndex` itself) |

#### `tests/infra/env-allowlist.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.6a | TC-4.6a: env allowlist filters parent env | Construct synthetic parent env with `PATH`, `HOME`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CUSTOM_LEAK` | Invoke `filterEnv(parent, { GITHUB_TOKEN: 'override' })` | Result contains `PATH`, `HOME`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`; does not contain `NODE_OPTIONS`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CUSTOM_LEAK` |

#### `tests/sdk/codex-resume.test.ts` (uses mock-codex shim, runs on default CI)

This file lives under `tests/sdk/` and runs on every default CI execution. It is intentionally outside `tests/integration/` because the integration project is env-gated to `LSPEC_INTEGRATION=1` and only runs with real provider binaries. AC-4.7a is a regression-prevention test that must run on every PR — placing it in the always-run sdk suite ensures it does.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.7a | TC-4.7a: Codex retained-session reuse | Use mock-codex shim that emits a captured fixture; story-implement returns `sessionId` | Story-continue with the captured `sessionId` | Mock invoked with `exec resume <sessionId>`; subsequent envelope echoes the same `sessionId` |

#### `tests/sdk/preflight.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.7b | TC-4.7b: preflight returns ready when binary present and auth unknown | Stub Codex binary as present; stub auth probe to return "unknown" | Invoke `preflight` | Envelope `status === 'ok'`; canonical `result.status === 'ready'`; `result.providerMatrix` has Codex with `tier: 'auth-unknown'`; `result.notes` (or the matching harness's `notes`) records the degraded fallback rationale |

#### `tests/code-quality/no-internal-mocks.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.8a | TC-4.8a: no mocks target internal modules | Walk `tests/` for mock declarations (`vi.mock`, `vi.spyOn` on imports) | Cross-reference targeted modules | Every targeted module is a Node builtin: `node:fs`, `node:fs/promises`, or `node:child_process`. No mock targets any path under `src/`. Provider behavior is substituted via the SpawnAdapter DI hook from AC-2.5 (a `spawn` function injected at the SDK boundary), not by mocking `src/core/provider-adapters/*`. |

#### `tests/parser-contract/fixtures.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-4.8b | TC-4.8b: external mock fixtures sourced from captured real output | Walk `tests/parser-contract/fixtures/` | Read each fixture's leading comment | Provenance comment present (provider, command, capture date); date parsable; no fixture missing provenance |

---

### Flow 5: Integration Verification

#### `tests/parser-contract/{claude-code,codex,copilot}.test.ts` — three files

Each provider's parser-contract suite runs every captured fixture through the corresponding parser and asserts the parsed output against an inline snapshot.

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.3a | TC-5.3a: captured-output contract tests run on default CI | Read each `tests/parser-contract/fixtures/<provider>/<scenario>.txt` | Invoke `parse<Provider>...(stdout)` | Parsed payload matches inline snapshot; assertion runs on default CI workflow |
| TC-5.3b | TC-5.3b: drift detection produces clear diff | Modify the parser locally to drop a field | Run the parser-contract test against an unchanged fixture | Test fails with a snapshot diff naming the missing field |

#### `tests/integration/smoke.test.ts` (env-gated)

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.1a | TC-5.1a per provider: smoke completes | `LSPEC_INTEGRATION=1`; provider binary on PATH | Invoke a basic operation under each provider in turn | Each returns valid envelope with `status === 'ok'` and produces the expected artifact |

#### `tests/integration/resume.test.ts` (env-gated)

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.1b | TC-5.1b per provider: resume with continuation handle | `LSPEC_INTEGRATION=1`; first call produced a `continuation` | Story-continue with the captured handle | Each returns a valid envelope; the resumed run's `continuation.sessionId` matches the original |

#### `tests/integration/structured-output.test.ts` (env-gated)

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.1c | TC-5.1c per provider: structured-output parses and forwards | `LSPEC_INTEGRATION=1`; run an operation that produces structured payload | Capture the parsed payload | Payload matches expected schema; envelope `result` contains the parsed payload unmodified |

#### `tests/integration/stall.test.ts` (env-gated)

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.1d | TC-5.1d per provider: stall detection terminates and surfaces | `LSPEC_INTEGRATION=1`; configure provider to produce no output for longer than the silence window | Invoke the operation | Provider subprocess terminated cleanly (no zombie); envelope `errors[0].code === 'PROVIDER_STALLED'`; status `blocked` |

#### `tests/integration/gating.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.2a | TC-5.2a: integration suite skipped without env flag | `LSPEC_INTEGRATION` unset | Run `vitest run --project integration` | Suite reports skipped (or zero tests run); no provider invoked |
| TC-5.2b | TC-5.2b: integration suite runs with env flag | `LSPEC_INTEGRATION=1`; provider binaries available | Run `vitest run --project integration` | All four scenario files execute and report per-provider results |

#### `tests/gorilla/fixture.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.4a | TC-5.4a: fixture present and complete | Read `gorilla/fixture-spec-pack/` | List required artifacts | `epic.md`, `tech-design.md`, `test-plan.md`, `stories/` directory with at least one story, `target-codebase/` directory all present |

#### `tests/gorilla/distribution.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.4b | TC-5.4b: fixture excluded from published tarball | Run `npm pack` | List tarball contents | No path under `gorilla/` appears in the listing |

#### `tests/gorilla/reset.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.5a | TC-5.5a: reset returns fixture to baseline | Snapshot fixture state pre-mutation; mutate fixture (write/delete a few files) | Run `gorilla/reset.ts` | Fixture state matches snapshot byte-for-byte |

#### `tests/gorilla/prompt-coverage.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.6a | TC-5.6a: prompt covers every operation | Read `gorilla/prompt.md` | Match operation names | All ten operations from the inventory mentioned at least once |
| TC-5.6b | TC-5.6b: prompt covers each provider for provider-consuming operations | Read `gorilla/prompt.md` | Match provider names | Claude Code, Codex, Copilot each mentioned at least once for the operations that consume providers |

#### `tests/gorilla/template.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-5.7a | TC-5.7a: evidence template captures required axes | Read `gorilla/evidence-template.md` | Match section headings | Sections present for: operation, envelope, artifact, continuation handle, divergences |
| TC-5.7b | TC-5.7b: end-to-end run produces valid evidence | Use a sample populated evidence report (committed as fixture) | Parse against the template | All required sections populated; report flags any unexpected behaviors observed |

#### Manual: TC-5.8a (deliberate-drift detection)

This is a manual pre-release verification, not an automated test. Documented in `gorilla/prompt.md` as a self-test of the gorilla pack. The procedure: introduce a parser change that breaks compatibility with one captured fixture, run the gorilla pack, confirm the agent's evidence report flags the divergence. Recorded as evidence in `gorilla/self-test-log.md`.

### Flow 6: Distribution and Release

#### `tests/dist/metadata.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|

| TC-6.2b | TC-6.2b: tarball respects files allowlist | List tarball contents | Cross-reference against `files` allowlist | Only `dist/`, `README*`, `LICENSE*`, `CHANGELOG*` present; no `tests/`, `gorilla/`, `scripts/`, source files |

#### `tests/dist/types.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-6.3a | TC-6.3a: types resolve under TypeScript | Set up a TypeScript consumer project that imports SDK types | Run `tsc --noEmit` | No errors; no `@ts-ignore` or manual declarations needed |

| TC-6.5d | TC-6.5d: gorilla evidence required for publish | Inspect publish.yml | Check evidence-verification step | Step verifies that at least one `gorilla/evidence/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` directory exists at HEAD where the directory date is within the configured release window (default 7 days before tag push); the directory contains one or more `<provider>-<scenario>.md` files per the canonical layout; fails with named-gate error message if absent or stale |
| TC-6.5e | TC-6.5e: all gates green publishes | Simulate a successful workflow run via dry-run mode | Run release workflow on a test tag | Publish runs; version on registry matches tag |

#### Manual / `tests/release/runbook.test.ts`

| TC | Test Name | Setup | Action | Assert |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| TC-6.6a | TC-6.6a: runbook structural completeness | Read `docs/release-runbook.md` | Parse section headings | Sections present for npm token configuration, organization setup, gorilla pre-tag procedure, first-publish rehearsal, post-publish verification |
| TC-6.7a | TC-6.7a: first-publish smoke | (manual) Install first published version through `npx`; run `inspect` against fresh fixture | Capture envelope | Exit 0; envelope valid; persisted artifact present |

## Mock Strategy

### The Critical Rule

**Mock at external boundaries only. Never mock internal modules.**

This rule is enforced by AC-4.8 and verified by `tests/code-quality/no-internal-mocks.test.ts`. Internal modules are mocked only by accident — every such accident is a test bug, not a feature.

### What Gets Mocked

| Layer | Mocked? | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Filesystem at temp-dir granularity | **No** | Tests create real temp directories under `os.tmpdir()`; fast, deterministic, exercises real `fs` behavior |
| `fs.rename` for atomic-write failure simulation | **Yes** (one test) | Single test in `tests/infra/fs-atomic.test.ts`; targeted external boundary mock for failure-injection |
| Provider subprocess (in unit/command/sdk tests) | **Yes** | Spawn boundary; mock-provider stub reads a captured fixture file and emits its content as stdout |
| Provider subprocess (in integration tests) | **No** | Real-harness suite spawns real provider binaries; env-gated |
| `child_process.spawn` (in env-allowlist test) | **Yes** (one test) | Single test in `tests/infra/env-allowlist.test.ts`; targeted to capture env passed to spawn |
| Internal workflow modules (`src/core/{story-implementor,story-verifier,epic-synthesizer,epic-verifier,epic-cleanup,quick-fix}.ts`) | **Never** | Forbidden; exercised through SDK function entry points |
| Internal SDK operations | **Never** | Forbidden; exercised through CLI commands |
| Internal infrastructure (`src/infra/*`) | **Never** | Forbidden; exercised through callers |
| Network | **Yes** if used | Not currently used by the package; if added, mock at the boundary |

### Captured-Output Fixtures Are Not Hand-Written Mocks

Provider subprocess mocks in unit/command/sdk tests use the captured-output fixtures from `tests/parser-contract/fixtures/<provider>/<scenario>.txt`. The mock-provider stub reads the requested fixture and pipes its content as the subprocess's stdout. This means: every "mock" of a provider is actually replaying real captured output. There are no hand-written mock outputs in the test suite.

The captured-output refresh procedure (per `scripts/capture-provider-output.ts`) re-records fixtures against current provider versions. The maintainer runs this on a cadence (per minor provider version bump, before each release if the prior fixture is older than 90 days, on every parser-contract test failure). This is documented in tech-design §Testing Strategy — Captured-Output Refresh Cadence.

---

## Fixtures

### Captured Provider Output

`tests/parser-contract/fixtures/<provider>/<scenario>.txt` — twelve files (3 providers × 4 scenarios). Each file's first line is a comment with provenance:

```
# Provider: codex
# Command: codex exec --output-format json -p '...'
# Captured: 2026-04-15
# Scenario: structured-output
# Fixture content follows ↓
{"type":"item.text","text":"...
```

The trailing content is exact captured stdout. Whitespace, ordering, and field shapes preserved as captured. Fixtures are committed to source control.

| Provider | Scenarios |
|----------|-----------|
| Claude Code | smoke, resume, structured-output, stall |
| Codex | smoke, resume, structured-output, stall |
| Copilot | smoke, resume, structured-output, stall |

### Workspace Builders

`tests/fixtures/workspaces.ts` — helper functions that create temp directories with controlled spec-pack content. Used by command tests, SDK tests, and unit tests.

| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `createMinimalSpecPack()` | epic.md + tech-design.md + test-plan.md + one story file; valid for inspect, preflight |
| `createSpecPackWithStories(n)` | Same plus `n` story files; valid for story workflows |
| `createSpecPackWithoutEpic()` | Triggers INVALID_SPEC_PACK; covers blocker paths |
| `createSpecPackWithCustomInsert(content)` | Adds `custom-story-impl-prompt-insert.md` at the configured path |
| `createSpecPackWithLargeInsert()` | Custom insert exceeding 64 KiB; triggers PROMPT_INSERT_INVALID |
| `withSpecPack(callback)` | Creates pack, runs callback, cleans up; resource-safe pattern |

### Mock Provider Stubs

`tests/fixtures/mock-providers.ts` — provides spawn-time stubs that emit captured fixture content as stdout for unit/command/sdk tests.

```typescript
// Test usage example
const codexStub = mockProvider({ provider: 'codex', scenario: 'structured-output' });
// codexStub returns a SpawnAdapter that, when invoked, emits the captured fixture as stdout.
const result = await storyImplement({ ..., spawn: codexStub });
```

The stubs do not invent output — they replay captured real output. Stub behavior is controlled by the `scenario` argument, which selects the captured fixture.

### Gorilla Fixture Spec Pack

`gorilla/fixture-spec-pack/` — a complete realistic spec pack used for end-to-end agent runs. Distinct from the unit-test workspace builders above. The fixture is committed to source but excluded from the published tarball via the `files` allowlist.

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `epic.md` | A small but realistic epic with ~3 flows and ~10 ACs |
| `tech-design.md` | Config A tech design for the epic |
| `test-plan.md` | Per-file TC mappings for the epic |
| `stories/00-foundation.md` through `stories/02-feature.md` | Three stories |
| `target-codebase/` | A small Node project (~10 source files) the operations operate on |

The fixture is reset between gorilla runs by `gorilla/reset.ts`, which restores the directory to its committed baseline state.

The `migrated/` test files from `liminal-spec/processes/impl-cli/tests/` keep their existing structure under `tests/` rather than getting renamed into the new layout above. The new layout above describes the new tests added by this epic; migrated tests retain their existing organization.

---

## Per-Chunk Test Tables

Each chunk's test count is the sum of its file totals below. Running totals propagate forward.

### Chunk 0: Toolchain Migration

| Test File | New Tests | TCs Covered |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `tests/foundation.test.ts` | 4 | TC-1.1a, TC-1.1b, TC-1.2a, TC-1.3a, TC-1.4a |
| `tests/verification-scripts.test.ts` | 4 | TC-1.3b (×4 sub-cases) |
| `tests/build-output.test.ts` | 1 | TC-1.4b |
| `tests/parity.test.ts` | 1 | TC-1.5b (TC-1.5a is a maintainer-run parity check, not an automated test in `lspec-core`; see §Manual: TC-1.5a) |
| Migrated tests | ~226 | (all from liminal-spec/processes/impl-cli/tests/) |
| **Chunk 0 Total** | **~236** | |

Note: TC-1.1a covers four assertions in one test; TC-1.3a covers four script names in one test; testing the assertions in a single test counts as one test. Test count totals reflect Vitest test definitions, not assertion count.

## Non-TC Decided Tests

Tests beyond 1:1 TC coverage. These are defensive, edge-case, or stress tests that the design judges valuable but that don't trace to a specific TC. They are listed here so they're not lost during story enrichment.

### Chunk 1
- **Per-operation envelope-shape tests (10 files).** Each operation's SDK function returns an envelope matching `CliResultEnvelope<TResult>` for both happy-path and error inputs. Defends against accidental envelope-shape regressions in any operation.

### Chunk 2
- **Help-text formatting test.** Each command's `--help` output includes its description and a usage example.
- **Arg-parse error test.** Each command rejects unknown flags with a non-zero exit code and a clear error message.

### Chunk 3
- **Atomic-write concurrency-stress.** Multiple concurrent writes to the same path; assert one wins, others fail cleanly with `AtomicWriteError`.
- **Index-reservation 3+ parallel.** Stress-test the retry loop with three parallel reservations; assert all distinct.
- **Index-reservation retry-cap exhaustion.** Pre-fill artifacts directory with reserved placeholders to force retry-cap exhaustion; assert `IndexReservationError`.
- **Env allowlist with empty parent env.** Empty parent env; assert filter returns empty plus overrides.
- **Codex resume across multiple turns.** Three consecutive resume calls; each propagates the prior session id correctly.
- **Preflight with degraded provider matrix.** Mixed binary-present, binary-missing, auth-unknown across three providers; assert the result correctly reports each tier and overall ready/not-ready status.
- **Schema-derivation breaking-change check.** Modify a canonical schema and assert the build fails (compile-time guard).
- **Atomic-write with concurrent writers to different paths.** Stress-test independent writes; assert no cross-contamination.
- **Persisted-state version backward-compat read.** Write a v1 state file; assert the loader accepts it; assert a fictional v2 file would be rejected (forward-compat guard).
- **Quick-fix typed arg errors.** Invocations with missing/extra args produce typed errors, not string-matched detection.

### Chunk 4
- **Cross-provider continuation-handle compatibility (negative).** A handle from one provider is rejected by a different provider's resume call with `CONTINUATION_HANDLE_INVALID`.
- **Silence-window edge — exactly at threshold.** Provider produces output at exactly the silence-window boundary; assert it is not classified as stalled.

### Chunk 5
- **Reset idempotency.** Running `reset.ts` twice produces the same state; second run is a no-op.
- **Fixture validates with inspect.** Running `inspect` against the gorilla fixture returns a `ready` envelope; the fixture is itself a valid spec pack.

### Chunk 6
- **Subpath imports under TypeScript and JavaScript.** Import from `@lspec/core/sdk`, `@lspec/core/sdk/contracts`, `@lspec/core/sdk/errors` from both a TS consumer and a JS consumer; both work.
- **Types-only import.** A consumer that imports `import type { CliResultEnvelope } from '@lspec/core/sdk/contracts'` produces no runtime cost (no JS emitted for the import).

### Chunk 7
- **YAML lint.** Workflow files pass `actionlint` (or equivalent) without warnings.

## Test Count Reconciliation

### Per-File and Per-Chunk Totals

| Chunk | New TC Tests | New Non-TC Tests | Migrated Tests | Chunk Total | Cumulative |
|-------|--------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 0 — Toolchain Migration | 11 | — | ~226 | ~237 | ~237 |
| 1 — SDK Surface | 9 | 10 | — | 19 | ~256 |
| 2 — CLI Surface | 10 | 2 | — | 12 | ~268 |
| 3 — Hardening | 15 | 10 | — | 25 | ~293 |
| 4 — Real-Harness | 16 | 2 | — | 28 | ~321 |
| 5 — Gorilla | 8 | 2 | — | 10 | ~331 |
| 6 — Distribution | 4 | 3 | — | 7 | ~338 |
| 7 — Release | 7 | 1 | — | 8 | ~346 |
| **Totals** | **80** | **30** | **~226** | **~346** | **~346** |

TC-1.5a is a maintainer-run parity check (one-shot, out-of-band) and is not counted as an automated test. See §Manual: TC-1.5a.

### Cross-Check

- Per-file totals in §Per-Chunk Test Tables sum to per-chunk totals here. ✓
- Per-chunk totals here sum to ~346 cumulative. ✓
- The tech-design index summary table (§Test Count Reconciliation in tech-design.md) reports the same per-chunk numbers. ✓
- This test plan is the source of truth for per-file totals; the tech-design index summary mirrors them. Any future change to per-file counts updates here first, then propagates to the index summary in a single mechanical pass.

### TC Coverage Completeness

| Flow | TC Count in Epic | TCs Mapped Here | Coverage |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Flow 1 — Toolchain | 11 | 10 + 1 manual | Complete (TC-1.5a is a maintainer-run parity check; see §Manual: TC-1.5a) |
| Flow 2 — SDK | 9 | 9 | Complete (includes AC-2.6 Zod 3 → Zod 4 migration: TC-2.6a, TC-2.6b) |
| Flow 3 — CLI | 7 | 7 | Complete |
| Flow 4 — Hardening | 15 | 15 | Complete |
| Flow 5 — Integration | 17 | 16 + 1 manual | Complete (TC-5.8a is manual pre-release verification) |
| Flow 6 — Distribution & Release | 12 | 11 + 1 manual | Complete (TC-6.7a is manual post-publish smoke) |
| **Totals** | **71** | **68 automated + 3 manual** | **71/71 covered** |

Every TC from the epic has a home in this document. Three TCs are manual verification rather than automated tests; each is noted explicitly with its manual procedure.

## Exploratory QA Scenarios

After TDD Green, manual exploratory testing catches "it works but feels wrong" cases that automated tests don't surface. These scenarios are recommended pre-release and are documented here for the maintainer's reference.

1. **Run a full epic end-to-end via the gorilla pack.** Use the gorilla fixture; walk every operation in sequence; record evidence. Catches integration friction the automated suite misses.

2. **Run with a degraded provider matrix.** Configure the run-config so that one provider is `secondary_harness: 'none'` and the other two are present. Confirm the run completes with degraded-fallback notes in the envelope.

3. **Interrupt a long-running story-implement and resume.** Kill the process mid-execution. Run story-continue with the captured continuation handle. Confirm the resumed session continues from the prior state.

4. **Provider auth expiration mid-run.** Manually expire the provider auth token. Confirm the package surfaces `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` cleanly, not a parse error or a timeout.

5. **Concurrent runs against the same spec pack.** Start two `inspect` operations simultaneously. Confirm both produce envelopes with distinct artifact indexes.

6. **Spec pack with all optional inserts present.** Custom story-impl insert, custom verifier insert, optional companion docs. Confirm inspect reports each as `present` and operations consume them.

7. **Spec pack on a network filesystem.** Mount the spec pack on an NFS share or similar. Confirm atomic writes and index reservations behave correctly across the network filesystem boundary.

8. **First-publish from a fresh maintainer machine.** Bootstrap the release workflow from a machine that hasn't published before. Confirm the runbook covers every required step.

9. **Release with stale gorilla evidence.** Tag a release with evidence dated 8 days old (outside the configured 7-day window). Confirm the workflow fails with the named-gate message.

10. **TypeScript consumer on Node 24.x and the current odd-numbered release.** A consumer project running both Node major versions imports the SDK and exercises a few operations. Confirms the package's Node 24 LTS minimum holds and that no API from the newer Node line leaked into the build.

These scenarios are not part of any automated suite and are not gated by any verification script. They live here as a maintainer's pre-release checklist.
