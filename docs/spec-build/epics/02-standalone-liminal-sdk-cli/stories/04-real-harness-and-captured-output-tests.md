# Story 4: Real-Harness Integration Tests + Captured-Output Contract Tests

### Summary
<!-- Jira: Summary field -->

Add captured real-provider fixtures, parser-contract tests, and an env-gated real-provider integration suite that exercises the highest-drift scenarios.

### Description
<!-- Jira: Description field -->

**User Profile:** Liminal Spec maintainer publishing the implementation runtime as a reusable npm package

**Objective:** Catch mock-versus-real drift before release by testing captured outputs on default CI and exercising real provider CLIs in a gated workflow.

**Scope In:**
- Captured real-provider output fixtures
- Parser-level contract tests on default CI
- Env-gated real-provider integration suite
- Smoke, resume, structured-output, and stall coverage across Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot
- Create `.github/workflows/integration.yml` (the env-gated workflow that runs the real-harness suite). This story owns the workflow file; Story 0 created the `.github/workflows/` directory.
- Capture and commit the parser-contract fixtures (used by the parser-contract tests defined in Story 3) sourced from real provider runs, with provenance comments — completing the satisfaction half of Story 3's AC-4.8b
- Parser-contract tests (defined in Story 3) verify that the captured fixtures parse cleanly through the production parsers, providing the structural assertion that fixtures are sourced from real captured output rather than hand-written

**Scope Out:**
- Gorilla prompt, reset tool, and evidence template
- Publish workflow and tag-gated release logic
- Any modification under `liminal-spec/processes/impl-cli/` or `liminal-spec/processes/codex-impl/`; work lands in the repo root and supporting repo-root config/docs only

**Dependencies:**
- Story 3 canonical contracts and regression fixes
- Real provider binaries available in the integration environment

### Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Jira: Acceptance Criteria field -->

**AC-5.1:** An automated integration test suite drives real provider CLIs across the scenarios that most often surface drift.

- **TC-5.1a:** Smoke per provider
  - Given: A spec pack and a working provider binary (Claude Code, Codex, or Copilot)
  - When: The smoke test invokes a basic operation under that provider
  - Then: The operation completes, returns a valid envelope, and produces the expected artifact
- **TC-5.1b:** Resume per provider
  - Given: An operation that produced a continuation handle
  - When: A subsequent operation invokes resume with that handle
  - Then: The provider continues the prior session and produces a valid envelope
- **TC-5.1c:** Structured-output parsing per provider
  - Given: A real provider run that produces structured output
  - When: The package parses the provider's stdout
  - Then: The parsed payload matches the schema and is forwarded to the SDK return value unchanged
- **TC-5.1d:** Stall and silence detection per provider
  - Given: A provider configured to produce no output for longer than the configured silence timeout
  - When: The package is invoked
  - Then: The package classifies the run as stalled, terminates the subprocess cleanly, and returns a `PROVIDER_STALLED` error

**AC-5.2:** The automated integration suite is gated by an environment flag and never runs on default CI runs.

- **TC-5.2a:** Default CI run skips the suite
  - Given: A default CI workflow run with no integration env flag set
  - When: The test command runs
  - Then: The integration suite is skipped and reports as such; no real provider is invoked
- **TC-5.2b:** Opt-in workflow runs the suite
  - Given: A separate CI workflow with the integration env flag set
  - When: The test command runs
  - Then: The integration suite executes against real providers and reports per-provider results

**AC-5.3:** Parser-level contract tests fed by captured real provider output run on every default CI run.

- **TC-5.3a:** Captured-output contract tests on default CI
  - Given: The default CI workflow
  - When: The test command runs
  - Then: Captured-output contract tests execute against the parser using the committed fixture samples and pass without invoking real providers
- **TC-5.3b:** Drift detection
  - Given: A change to the parser that breaks compatibility with a real captured sample
  - When: The default CI workflow runs
  - Then: The contract test fails with a clear diff between expected and actual parsed shape
- **TC-4.8b.2:** Captured real-provider fixtures used by parser-contract tests are sourced from real captured output (satisfying half of Story 3's AC-4.8b)
  - Given: The committed fixture files under `tests/support/parser-contract-fixtures/providers/<provider>/<scenario>.txt` at the end of this story
  - When: A reviewer inspects each fixture's leading provenance comment
  - Then: Each fixture identifies a real provider run by provider, command, and capture date; the dates parse; the parser-contract tests defined in Story 3 (`tests/unit/parser-contract/{claude-code,codex,copilot}.test.ts`) pass against these real fixtures, proving the AC-4.8b rule end-to-end

**Relevant boundary contracts**

**Integration Coverage Matrix**

| Layer | Runtime Surface | Required Scope |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Parser-contract tests | Default CI | Captured real-provider samples parsed without invoking real providers |
| Real-harness integration suite | Env-gated workflow | Smoke, resume, structured-output, and stall scenarios across Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot |

**Captured Fixture Provenance Contract**

| Field | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Provider | Fixture identifies which real provider produced the captured output |
| Command/scenario | Fixture identifies the command or scenario class it represents |
| Capture date | Fixture provenance records when the sample was captured |
| Usage | Fixture is committed and consumed by parser-contract tests on default CI |

**Integration Workflow Gate**

| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Integration env flag absent | Real-provider suite is skipped |
| Integration env flag present in dedicated workflow | Real-provider suite executes and reports per-provider results |

**CLI Output Envelope**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| command | string | yes | Name of the command that produced the envelope |
| version | integer | yes | Envelope schema version; consumers branch on this |
| status | enum | yes | One of `ok`, `needs-user-decision`, `blocked`, `error` |
| outcome | string | yes | Command-specific outcome string for human display |
| result | object | no | Command-specific structured result; absent on hard failure |
| errors | array of CliError | yes | Empty when status is `ok` |
| warnings | array of string | yes | Non-fatal messages; may be empty |
| artifacts | array of CliArtifactRef | yes | Persisted artifact paths; may be empty |
| startedAt | ISO 8601 UTC | yes | Timestamp when the command began execution |
| finishedAt | ISO 8601 UTC | yes | Timestamp when the envelope was finalized |

**CliError**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| code | string | yes | Stable error code from the package's error taxonomy |
| message | string | yes | Human-readable summary |
| detail | string | no | Optional context detail; not parsed by callers |

**Operation Inventory**

| Operation | Purpose | Continuation Handle |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| inspect | Validate spec pack and return inventory | no |
| preflight | Resolve provider availability and verification gates | no |
| epic-synthesize | Generate or refresh epic-level synthesis output | no |
| epic-verify | Run epic-level verification | no |
| epic-cleanup | Run pre-epic-verification cleanup | no |
| quick-fix | Apply a one-shot fix | no |
